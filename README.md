# NeuralNetworkMarksDecryption
## Introduction
This project is a marks decryption artifial neural network (ANN) system, which is to test the marks decryption ability of an ANN based on the encrypting algorithm created by myself. The ANN is a supervised backpropagation ANN. It is my assignment for the subject Computational Intelligence during my undergraduate semester 7.

## Methodology
### Architecture
For the architecture of the ANN, I used 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer. The details of the architecture can be seen in the diagram below.

### Neuron
For the neuron, I used the linear combination technique to calculate the inputs.
